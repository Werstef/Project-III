In order to connect the Database files to the project it is needed to copy and paste the .mdf and .ldf file in the localhost folder(usually Users\user).
Try to run the project, it should work without a problem, if it has a problem loading the database, create a new one using the Tools->Nuget Console.
"Add-Migration Migration1 -context KristMedV2DbContext"
"Update-Database -context KristMedV2DbContext"
Message me if problems arise though I hope it will work without a problem.
